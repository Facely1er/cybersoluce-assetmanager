✅ CURSOR TODO — Verify & Complete CyberSoluce as Asset Intelligence Layer

PROJECT: CyberSoluce
GOAL:

Lock CyberSoluce as the Asset Intelligence & Dependency Visibility layer

Verify focus funnels (privacy / ransomware / vendor / software / governance)

Add one explanatory screen

Enforce guardrails (no fake posture / compliance)

1️⃣ Naming & Positioning Sanity Sweep
// TODO[CS-NAMING-POSITIONING-CHECK]:

1. Full-text search the repo for these terms (case-insensitive):
   - "Asset Manager"
   - "asset manager"
   - "IAM"
   - "Intelligent Asset Manager"
   - "CMDB"
   - "posture"
   - "compliant"
   - "certified"

2. For UI-facing occurrences:
   - Replace any "Asset Manager" phrasing with:
     - "Asset Intelligence" or
     - "Asset Intelligence & Dependency Visibility"
   - Remove any "IAM" product-name style references.
   - Ensure "posture", "compliant", "certified" do NOT appear in user-facing CyberSoluce UI.

3. For internal-only comments:
   - Keep "intelligent asset manager" ONLY if clearly marked as internal design label, e.g.:

     /**
      * INTERNAL DESIGN NOTE:
      * CyberSoluce serves as the asset intelligence layer for the ERMITS ecosystem.
      * Do not present this as a standalone "Asset Manager" product to users.
      */

4. Stop when:
   - No user-facing copy describes CyberSoluce as:
     - "Asset Manager"
     - "CMDB"
     - "posture" / "compliant" / "certified" anything.

2️⃣ Guardrail Comments in Enrichment & Funnel
// TODO[CS-GUARDRAILS-ASSET-INTEL]:

1. Open enrichment service:
   - src/services/assetEnrichmentService.ts

2. At the TOP of the file, add:

   /**
    * CyberSoluce Asset Intelligence Layer
    *
    * NOTE:
    * - This logic surfaces QUALITATIVE focus signals only.
    * - It must never claim:
    *     - Overall security posture
    *     - Compliance / certification
    *     - Formal risk ratings
    * - Outputs are indicative and require deeper, asset-based evaluation
    *   in the relevant ERMITS products (CyberCorrect, CyberCaution, VendorSoluce, TechnoSoluce, ERMITS Advisory).
    */

3. Open signal detection service:
   - src/services/signalDetectionService.ts

4. Add similar note at the top:

   /**
    * Signal Detection – focuses on WHERE attention may be needed,
    * not WHAT to do next.
    *
    * Outputs must remain:
    * - Qualitative
    * - Non-prescriptive
    * - Free of scoring / posture claims
    */

5. Open focus funnel UI:
   - src/components/FocusFunnel.tsx

6. Add at top:

   /**
    * FocusFunnel shows where attention clusters (privacy, ransomware, vendor, software, governance).
    * It must NOT:
    * - Act as a remediation engine
    * - Present posture or compliance conclusions
    * - Directly sell or mandate ERMITS products
    */

3️⃣ “How Asset Intelligence Works” Page
// TODO[CS-INFO-PAGE-ASSET-INTEL]:

1. Create new page component:
   - File: src/pages/HowAssetIntelligenceWorks.tsx

2. Component content (structure; wording can be close to this):

   - H1: "How CyberSoluce Asset Intelligence Works"

   - Section 1: "What CyberSoluce Does"
     - Bullet list:
       - "Creates a dependency-aware view of systems, vendors, and data"
       - "Normalizes asset information from imports and manual input"
       - "Highlights where exposure and dependencies may concentrate"

   - Section 2: "What It Does Not Do"
     - Bullet list:
       - "Does not provide compliance or certification status"
       - "Does not rate overall enterprise posture"
       - "Does not replace expert, human-led analysis"

   - Section 3: "How Focus Areas Are Used"
     - Copy example:
       - "When patterns emerge (e.g., sensitive data with unclear lineage, vendor concentration, software clustering), CyberSoluce surfaces them as focus areas."
       - "Specialized ERMITS products provide deeper evaluation of those areas."

   - Section 4: "Where It Fits in ERMITS"
     - Short paragraph:
       - "CyberSoluce sits at the foundation of the ERMITS ecosystem as the asset intelligence layer. It helps CyberCorrect, CyberCaution, VendorSoluce, TechnoSoluce, and ERMITS Advisory start from a cleaner map of what matters."

3. Wire this page to the router:
   - Open main routing file (likely src/App.tsx or src/router/AppRouter.tsx)
   - Add a route:
     - path: "/how-asset-intelligence-works"
     - element: <HowAssetIntelligenceWorks />

4. Add link from main nav or dashboard:
   - Location suggestion:
     - In top-level nav under "Help" or "About"
     - OR as a small link on the main Asset Intelligence / dashboard page:
       - Label: "How Asset Intelligence Works"

5. Ensure:
   - No marketing language like "ultimate", "guaranteed", etc.
   - The role statement is clear:
     - "Asset Intelligence & Dependency Visibility foundation for ERMITS"

4️⃣ Focus Funnel – Routing & Copy Verification
// TODO[CS-FOCUSFUNNEL-ROUTES-VERIFY]:

1. Open:
   - src/components/FocusFunnel.tsx

2. For each focus block, verify the routing target:

   - Privacy focus → CyberCorrect:
     - CTA label example: "Review privacy exposure in more detail"
     - Link / route:
       - Internal: "/cybercorrect" or
       - External: https://cybercorrect.com (depending on current design)

   - Ransomware focus → CyberCaution:
     - CTA: "Explore ransomware readiness"
     - Route/Link: CyberCaution target

   - Vendor dependence → VendorSoluce:
     - CTA: "Examine vendor concentration and dependencies"
     - Route/Link: VendorSoluce target

   - Software concentration → TechnoSoluce:
     - CTA: "Look deeper at software & SBOM risk"
     - Route/Link: TechnoSoluce target (even if placeholder for now)

   - Governance ambiguity → ERMITS Advisory:
     - CTA: "Discuss governance and decision clarity"
     - Route/Link: ERMITS Advisory site or contact page

3. Copy rules:
   - Allowed phrases:
     - "may warrant deeper evaluation"
     - "could be explored further"
     - "signals that might benefit from a closer look"

   - Forbidden phrases:
     - "you must"
     - "you need Product X"
     - "fix now"
     - "this proves you should buy"

4. If any CTA uses hard-sell or prescriptive language, soften to:
   - "Explore deeper evaluation options"
   - "See how this area can be examined in more detail"

5. Make sure:
   - FocusFunnel does not list **prices**, **plans**, or **offers**.
   - It only points attention to where deeper evaluation lives in the ecosystem.

5️⃣ Demo Mode Safety for Sector Generator

(You already have generator + SectorDemoLauncher, but we lock the safety.)

// TODO[CS-DEMO-SAFETY-VERIFY]:

1. Confirm demo generator file:
   - src/demo/sampleAssetInventoryGenerator.ts
   - Has header comment with:
     - "DEMO-ONLY"
     - "must never be used as real evidence"

2. Confirm demo manager:
   - src/demo/demoDataManager.ts (or similar)
   - Demo assets are tagged with:
     - demo: true OR demoNote: "DEMO_ONLY_NOT_REAL"

3. Confirm launch UI:
   - src/demo/SectorDemoLauncher.tsx

   - Check:
     - Text explicitly states:
       - "This is demo data" or
       - "Fictional data generated for illustration only"
     - Button label is something like:
       - "Launch Sector Demo"

4. Check dashboards when in demo mode:
   - FocusFunnel or main dashboard should show a visible badge or banner:
     - "Demo mode: viewing fictional sector data (not your environment)."

5. Confirm:
   - There is NO export or "report download" in demo mode without DEMO disclaimer.
   - No wording implies this demo data reflects the customer’s environment.

6️⃣ Final Asset Intelligence Checklist (Cursor Must Confirm)
// TODO[CS-ASSET-INTEL-FINAL-VERIFY]:

Before closing this work, verify ALL of the following:

☐ No user-facing copy calls CyberSoluce:
   - "Asset Manager"
   - "CMDB"
   - or claims "posture", "compliant", "certified"

☐ Enrichment and signal detection services have guardrail comments.

☐ "How Asset Intelligence Works" page exists, is reachable from UI,
   and clearly states:
   - what CyberSoluce does,
   - what it does NOT do,
   - how focus areas connect to ERMITS products.

☐ FocusFunnel:
   - Uses only qualitative language.
   - Routes to CyberCorrect / CyberCaution / VendorSoluce / TechnoSoluce / ERMITS Advisory.
   - Does not prescribe purchases or remediation.

☐ Demo mode:
   - Clearly labeled.
   - Fictional data cannot be mistaken for real evidence.

If ANY checkbox fails → mark TODO as INCOMPLETE and fix before considering CyberSoluce “locked” as the Asset Intelligence foundation.
