# TODO – TechnoSoluce SBOM Integration Design (Signal-Only, Contract-Safe)

## Objective (Non-Negotiable)

Integrate **SBOM-derived software composition facts** into the ERMITS ecosystem such that:
- TechnoSoluce is the **only** system that ingests and interprets SBOMs.
- CyberSoluce **never parses SBOMs**, never computes risk, never scores.
- Outputs are **qualitative signals only**, aligned with existing contracts.
- Integration unlocks future **change-over-time intelligence** without redesign.

---

## 1. Define SBOM Boundary Contracts (Authoritative)

### 1.1 Create SBOM Intake Contract (TechnoSoluce-only)

**File:** `src/contracts/technoSoluce.sbom.contract.ts`

**Tasks:**
- Define an `SBOMIntake` interface representing factual SBOM data only.
- Supported formats as metadata (do not parse yet):
  - SPDX
  - CycloneDX
- Fields allowed:
  - `sbomId`
  - `format`
  - `generatedAt`
  - `toolName`
  - `componentsCount`
  - `hasLicenses: boolean`
  - `hasDependencies: boolean`
  - `source: 'upload' | 'repo' | 'ci'`

**Explicitly forbidden:**
- CVE
- severity
- score
- compliance
- pass/fail

Add a header comment:
> “This contract represents software composition facts, not security posture.”

## 2. Translate SBOM Facts → Qualitative Signals

### 2.1 Define SBOM-Derived Signal Types

**File:** `src/contracts/technoSoluce.sbom.signals.ts`

**Tasks:**
- Define **only** the following signal types (enum or union):

```ts
type SBOMSignalType =
  | 'software-composition-known'
  | 'software-composition-partial'
  | 'software-composition-unknown'
  | 'transitive-dependency-opacity'
  | 'component-churn-detected';
Define SBOMSignal extending AssetSignal without adding fields.

Example wording rules:

✅ “Software components listed but dependency depth incomplete”

❌ “High risk due to vulnerable dependencies”

2.2 Build SBOM Signal Builder
File: src/technoSoluce/sbom/sbomSignalBuilder.ts

Tasks:

Create a pure function:

ts
Copy code
buildSBOMSignals(
  sbom: SBOMIntake,
  linkedAssetIds: string[]
): AssetSignal[]
Logic rules (simple, explicit):

If no SBOM → software-composition-unknown

If components listed but no dependency graph → software-composition-partial

If component count changes week-over-week (stub for now) → component-churn-detected

If dependencies exceed depth threshold without identifiers → transitive-dependency-opacity

No heuristics. No scoring. No vuln logic.

3. Asset Binding (Minimal & Reversible)
3.1 Map SBOMs to Assets (No Assumptions)
File: src/technoSoluce/sbom/sbomAssetBinding.ts

Tasks:

Create a lightweight binding model:

ts
Copy code
type SBOMAssetBinding = {
  sbomId: string;
  assetId: string;
  bindingSource: 'user-declared' | 'repository-link' | 'ci-pipeline';
};
No automatic inference beyond declared links.

If multiple assets reference the same SBOM, allow it.

4. Export SBOM Signals Back Into Ecosystem
4.1 TechnoSoluce → CyberSoluce Export Adapter
File: src/exports/technoSoluceToCyberSoluce.ts

Tasks:

Export signals only (never raw SBOM data).

Adapter signature:

ts
Copy code
export function exportSBOMSignalsToCyberSoluce(
  signals: AssetSignal[]
): AssetSignal[];
Enforce:

Signal types must be from SBOMSignalType

All text fields validated via contractGuard

4.2 Funnel Compatibility Check
File: src/funnel/useFocusFunnel.ts

Tasks:

Verify funnel logic correctly routes:

SBOM-related signals → TechnoSoluce (default)

SBOM + ransomware-related user intent → CyberCaution

SBOM + vendor-linked assets → VendorSoluce

Do not add new destinations.

Do not embed SBOM logic here—routing only.

5. Demo Extension (Optional but Recommended)
5.1 Extend Sector Demo with SBOM Awareness
File: src/demo/sectorDemoSignals.ts

Tasks:

For SaaS and Manufacturing sectors:

Inject mock SBOM-derived signals using SBOMSignalType

Mark source: 'inferred' and confidence: 'low'

Add demo copy:

“Software composition visibility available via TechnoSoluce”

No fake SBOM files. No CVE talk.

6. Guardrails (Mandatory)
6.1 Update contractGuard Forbidden Keywords
File: src/guards/contractGuard.ts

Tasks:

Ensure SBOM-related exports are blocked if they contain:

cve

vulnerability

severity

exploit

patch

secure / insecure

These belong downstream, not here.

7. Documentation (Boundary Lock)
7.1 Update Ecosystem Data Boundaries
File: docs/ecosystem-data-boundaries.md

Add section:

TechnoSoluce (Software Composition Intelligence)
Include:

SBOM ingestion responsibility

Signal-only exports

What CyberSoluce can/cannot say about software

Explicit statement:

“CyberSoluce never evaluates software risk or vulnerabilities.”

8. Validation Checklist (Must All Pass)
 CyberSoluce contains zero SBOM parsing code

 SBOM signals appear only as qualitative visibility markers

 No CVE, severity, or score strings anywhere in payloads

 Export adapters pass contractGuard

 Funnel routes SBOM signals predictably

 Removing SBOM module does not break CyberSoluce

If any fail: fix the boundary, not the symptom.
