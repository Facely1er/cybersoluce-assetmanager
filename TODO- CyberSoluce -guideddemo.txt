# TODO – CyberSoluce Guided Demo (Sector-Based Asset Inventories)

## Goal

Turn CyberSoluce into a **guided sales demo** where:
- The user picks **Sector + Size + Scenario**.
- CyberSoluce loads a **sector-specific asset inventory** using the existing demo generator.
- Assets are wrapped in the **data contracts** you just implemented.
- The **focus funnel** routes them to the right ERMITS product with clear rationale.
- Absolutely **no scores / posture / compliance** leak in.

---

## 1) Sector Demo Domain Layer

### 1.1 Create a sector demo config model

**File:** `src/demo/sectorDemoConfig.ts`

**Tasks:**
- Define a `SectorDemoConfig` type that links:
  - `sectorId` (e.g., `"healthcare"`, `"financial"`, `"saas"`, `"manufacturing"`, `"education"`, `"publicSector"`)
  - `orgSize` (e.g., `"small" | "medium" | "large"`)
  - `primaryScenario` (e.g., `"privacy" | "ransomware" | "vendor-risk" | "software-supply-chain"`)
  - `defaultSignals`: array of `AssetSignal` (from `cyberSoluce.signal.contract.ts`) that should be injected for the demo.

- Export a `SECTOR_DEMO_CONFIGS: SectorDemoConfig[]` covering at least:
  - Healthcare – small/medium/large (privacy + ransomware)
  - Financial – small/medium/large (privacy + vendor-risk)
  - SaaS – small/medium/large (software-supply-chain + ransomware)

> Constraint: **no scores, no compliance labels**, only qualitative descriptions.

---

### 1.2 Wrap demo assets with contracts

**File (or existing):** `src/demo/sampleAssetInventoryGenerator.ts`

**Tasks:**
- Ensure the generator returns assets that conform to `AssetContract` from `cyberSoluce.asset.contract.ts`.
- If needed, add a helper:

  ```ts
  import { AssetContract } from '@/contracts/cyberSoluce.asset.contract';

  export function generateSectorDemoAssets(
    sectorId: string,
    orgSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'
  ): AssetContract[] {
    // use existing generator logic but ensure it returns AssetContract[]
  }


Validate that no forbidden fields (score, rating, compliance, etc.) are being added.

If any such fields exist in the old demo, strip them here.

1.3 Inject demo signals

File: src/demo/sectorDemoSignals.ts

Tasks:

Create a function:

import { AssetSignal } from '@/contracts/cyberSoluce.signal.contract';
import { SectorDemoConfig } from './sectorDemoConfig';

export function buildSectorDemoSignals(
  assets: AssetContract[],
  config: SectorDemoConfig
): AssetSignal[] {
  // combine config.defaultSignals with a few asset-specific signals
}


Rule:

Signals describe exposure, dependency, change, uncertainty.

No “high risk”, “critical”, “non-compliant” wording.

Use phrases like:

“unclear vendor data processing terms”

“unmapped third-party dependency”

“uncertain backup ownership”

“opaque SaaS-to-SaaS integration chain”

2) Guided Demo UI – Sector → Assets → Focus Funnel
2.1 Create a Sector Demo Entry Screen

File: src/features/demo/SectorDemoLauncher.tsx

Tasks:

Build a simple 3-step selector:

Sector (dropdown / cards)

Organization size

Scenario focus (privacy / ransomware / vendor-risk / software-supply-chain)

Store selected values in local component state and expose a “Start Guided Demo” button.

When clicked:

Call generateSectorDemoAssets(sectorId, orgSize)

Call buildSectorDemoSignals(assets, config)

Pass both into a new SectorDemoOrchestrator component.

2.2 Create Sector Demo Orchestrator

File: src/features/demo/SectorDemoOrchestrator.tsx

Tasks:

Props:

type SectorDemoOrchestratorProps = {
  assets: AssetContract[];
  signals: AssetSignal[];
  config: SectorDemoConfig;
};


Responsibilities:

Display summary:

“Sector: Healthcare | Size: 500–1,000 staff | Scenario: Privacy”

Show asset list preview (10–20 assets, grouped by category).

Highlight a few notable signals (“unmapped SaaS dependencies”, “unknown vendor data flow”).

Add a CTA: “See What We Do With This Intelligence”

On click, feed key signals + user intent into useFocusFunnel (next section).

3) Wire into useFocusFunnel (Demo Mode)
3.1 Extend useFocusFunnel to support demo mode

File: src/funnel/useFocusFunnel.ts

Tasks:

Add an optional mode?: 'live' | 'demo' parameter.

Default is 'live'.

In demo mode:

Do not call any real APIs or persistence.

Use only the passed-in signals + config.primaryScenario + a simple userIntent string.

Example usage:

const { destination, rationale } = useFocusFunnel({
  signals,
  userIntent: 'explore-privacy-impact',
  mode: 'demo',
});


Outputs must include:

destination.product (e.g., 'CyberCorrect' | 'CyberCaution' | 'VendorSoluce' | 'TechnoSoluce' | 'ERMITSAdvisory')

destination.handoffIntent (string from export manifest)

rationale.title, rationale.body (plain text, no scores)

3.2 Connect Orchestrator → Funnel → Export Adapters

File: src/features/demo/SectorDemoOrchestrator.tsx

Tasks:

After calling useFocusFunnel, display:

“Recommended next step: CyberCorrect – Privacy Impact & Compliance” (example)

2–3 bullet rationale lines from rationale.body.

Add a “Show Handoff Payload” toggle (for sales engineers):

When enabled, show the JSON produced by the corresponding export adapter, e.g.:

const exportPayload = toCyberCorrect(assets, signals);


This must strictly conform to your contracts and be validated via contractGuard.

Ensure that if contractGuard throws:

In dev: show a visible warning banner “Demo payload violated data contract – see console”.

In prod: fail silently but never show broken payloads.

4) Guardrails – Demo vs Real Data
4.1 Add a Demo Mode Flag

File: src/config/appConfig.ts (or existing config)

Tasks:

Add:

export const APP_MODES = {
  demo: true, // can be toggled by env
  live: true,
} as const;


Use environment variables (VITE_CYBERSOLUCE_DEMO_ENABLED or similar) to enable/disable the Sector Demo from navigation.

4.2 Prevent Demo Data from Polluting Live Flows

Files to update:

src/router/... (where routes are defined)

Any global store that might receive assets/signals

Tasks:

Ensure demo assets/signals are contained within demo components.

Do not persist demo data into any shared store or backend.

If you have global state for assets, wrap demo usage in a dedicated key, e.g. demoAssets instead of assets.

5) UX & Copy – Sales-Grade, No Overreach
5.1 Demo Landing Copy

File: src/features/demo/SectorDemoLauncher.tsx

Tasks:

Add a short description (static text) above the sector selector:

Line 1 (headline):
“See how asset intelligence drives your next cybersecurity move.”

Line 2–3 (supporting):
“Pick a sector and scenario. We’ll generate a realistic asset map, highlight weak visibility points, and show you which ERMITS product takes over from there – without scores or compliance claims.”

5.2 Handoff Explanation Panel

File: src/features/demo/SectorDemoOrchestrator.tsx

Tasks:

Below the “Recommended next step” area, add a small info panel:

Title: “What happens next?”

3 bullet points:

“CyberSoluce stops at asset intelligence and qualitative signals.”

“Specialized ERMITS products interpret those signals for privacy, threats, vendors, or software supply chain.”

“You stay in control of decisions – our tools just make the landscape visible.”

No mention of “guarantee”, “compliance ready”, or similar language.

6) Minimal QA Checklist (No Visual Guessing)

Before you call this done, verify:

 Selecting different sectors/sizes actually changes the assets and signals shown.

 useFocusFunnel only uses contract-backed signals + user intent (no raw asset shortcuts).

 Export payloads (toCyberCorrect, toCyberCaution, etc.) all pass contractGuard in demo flows.

 There is no occurrence of score, rating, maturity, compliance in payloads, UI labels, or copy.

 Disabling demo mode via env removes the Sector Demo entry from navigation.

If any check fails, fix at the source (contracts / adapters / copy), not by adding exceptions.


If you want next, we can do **TechnoSoluce SBOM integration (C)** _after_ this, using the same contracts and funnel so you don’t end up rebuilding anything twice.
